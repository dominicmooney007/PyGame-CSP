## üéÆ Core PyGame Setup Functions

### `pygame.init()`
**What it does:** Starts up PyGame and gets everything ready to work.

**Why you need it:** This MUST be the first PyGame command in your program.

**Example:**
```python
import pygame
pygame.init()  # Always do this first!
```

**Think of it like:** Turning on a video game console - you have to power it on before you can play.

---

### `pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))`
**What it does:** Creates the window where your game will appear.

**Parameters:**
- `width`: How wide the window should be (in pixels)
- `height`: How tall the window should be (in pixels)

**Returns:** A "screen" object that you draw on

**Example:**
```python
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))  # Makes 800x600 window
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1200, 800)) # Makes 1200x800 window
```

**Think of it like:** Getting a blank canvas to paint on - you choose the size.

---

### `pygame.display.set_caption("Your Title")`
**What it does:** Sets the title that appears at the top of your window.

**Example:**
```python
pygame.display.set_caption("My Awesome Game")
pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game v1.0")
```

**Think of it like:** Putting a title on your artwork.

---

### `pygame.display.flip()`
**What it does:** Shows everything you've drawn on the screen.

**Why you need it:** Without this, you won't see anything! You draw things, then "flip" to display them.

**Example:**
```python
# Draw some stuff
pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 0, 0), (100, 100), 50)
# Now show it
pygame.display.flip()  # This makes it appear!
```

**Think of it like:** Flipping a page to reveal what you've drawn on it.

---

### `pygame.time.Clock()`
**What it does:** Creates a timer to control how fast your game runs.

**Returns:** A clock object you can use to control timing

**Example:**
```python
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
# Later in your game loop:
clock.tick(60)  # Run at 60 frames per second
```

**Think of it like:** A metronome that keeps your game running at a steady beat.

---

### `clock.tick(fps)`
**What it does:** Controls how many times per second your game loop runs.

**Parameters:**
- `fps`: Frames per second (usually 60 for smooth animation)

**Example:**
```python
clock = pygame.time.Clock()
while running:
    # Game code here
    clock.tick(60)  # Limits to 60 FPS
```

**Think of it like:** Setting the speed limit for your game.

---

### `pygame.quit()`
**What it does:** Properly closes PyGame when you're done.

**Why you need it:** Good programming practice - cleans up properly.

**Example:**
```python
pygame.quit()  # Put this at the very end
sys.exit()     # This too
```

**Think of it like:** Turning off the video game console when you're done playing.

    elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:
            print("Space was pressed!")
        elif event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
            running = False  # Close game with Escape
    
    elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
        if event.button == 1:  # Left mouse button
            mouse_x, mouse_y = event.pos
            print(f"Left clicked at ({mouse_x}, {mouse_y})")
        elif event.button == 3:  # Right mouse button
            print("Right mouse button clicked!")
```

**Think of it like:** Having a secretary who tells you "Someone just knocked on the door" or "The phone is ringing."

## üìä Useful Math and Utility Functions

### `math.sqrt(number)`
**What it does:** Calculates the square root of a number.

**Example:**
```python
import math
distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)  # Distance between points
```

---

### `random.randint(min, max)`
**What it does:** Gives you a random whole number between min and max (including both).

**Example:**
```python
import random
x = random.randint(0, 800)    # Random number from 0 to 800
dice = random.randint(1, 6)   # Random dice roll
```

---

### `random.choice(list)`
**What it does:** Picks a random item from a list.

**Example:**
```python
import random
colors = [(255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), (0, 0, 255)]
random_color = random.choice(colors)  # Picks red, green, or blue
```

## üéØ Common Patterns and How They Work

### The Main Game Loop
**What it does:** This is the heart of every game - it runs over and over.

```python
running = True
while running:          # Keep going until running becomes False
    # 1. Handle events (mouse clicks, key presses)
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
    
    # 2. Update game (move things, check collisions)
    player_x += player_speed
    
    # 3. Draw everything
    screen.fill((255, 255, 255))  # Clear screen
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, (255, 0, 0), (player_x, player_y), 20)
    
    # 4. Show what we drew
    pygame.display.flip()
    
    # 5. Wait a bit (control game speed)
    clock.tick(60)
```

**Think of it like:** A flipbook animation - draw a picture, flip the page, draw the next picture, flip the page, repeat.

---

### Boundary Checking
**What it does:** Keeps things from going off the edge of the screen.

```python
# Keep player on screen
if player_x < 0:
    player_x = 0
if player_x > 800:
    player_x = 800
    
# Or with object size
if player_x < player_size:
    player_x = player_size
if player_x > WIDTH - player_size:
    player_x = WIDTH - player_size
```

**Think of it like:** Building a fence around your yard to keep your dog from running away.

---

### Collision Detection
**What it does:** Checks if two things are touching.

```python
def circles_touching(x1, y1, radius1, x2, y2, radius2):
    distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
    return distance < (radius1 + radius2)

# Use it like this:
if circles_touching(player_x, player_y, 20, enemy_x, enemy_y, 30):
    print("Player hit enemy!")
```

**Think of it like:** Checking if two bubbles are touching by measuring the distance between their centers.

---

## üîß Debugging Tips

### Print Statements
**Use these to see what's happening:**
```python
print(f"Player position: ({player_x}, {player_y})")
print(f"Mouse position: {pygame.mouse.get_pos()}")
print(f"Number of enemies: {len(enemies)}")
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem:** Nothing appears on screen
**Solution:** Make sure you call `pygame.display.flip()`

**Problem:** Game runs too fast/slow
**Solution:** Use `clock.tick(60)` to control speed

**Problem:** Can't see what you drew
**Solution:** Make sure you call `screen.fill()` before drawing new things

**Problem:** Events don't work
**Solution:** Make sure your event handling is inside the main game loop
